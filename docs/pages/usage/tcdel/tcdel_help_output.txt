    usage: tcdel [-h] [--version] [--tc-command | --tc-script] [--debug | --quiet]
                 [--stacktrace] -d DEVICE [-a] [--id FILTER_ID]
                 [--direction {outgoing,incoming}] [--network DST_NETWORK]
                 [--src-network SRC_NETWORK] [--port DST_PORT]
                 [--src-port SRC_PORT] [--ipv6]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      --tc-command          display tc commands to be executed and exit. these
                            commands are not executed.
      --tc-script           generate a script file that described tc commands
                            which equivalent with execution tcconfig command. the
                            script can be execute without tcconfig package
                            installation.
      --debug               for debug print.
      --quiet               suppress execution log messages.

    Debug:
      --stacktrace          print stack trace for debug information. --debug
                            option required to see the debug print.

    Traffic Control:
      -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                            network device name (e.g. eth0)
      -a, --all             delete all of the shaping rules.
      --id FILTER_ID        delete a shaping rule which has a specific id. you can
                            get an id (filter_id) by tcshow command output. e.g.
                            "filter_id": "800::801"

    Routing:
      --direction {outgoing,incoming}
                            the direction of network communication that impose
                            traffic control. 'incoming' requires Linux kernel
                            version 2.6.20 or later. (default = outgoing)
      --network DST_NETWORK, --dst-network DST_NETWORK
                            target IP-address/network to control traffic
      --src-network SRC_NETWORK
                            set a traffic shaping rule to specific packets that
                            routed from --src-network to --dst-network. this
                            option required to execute with the --iptables option
                            when you use tbf. the shaping rule only affect to
                            outgoing packets (no effect to if you execute with "--
                            direction incoming" option)
      --port DST_PORT, --dst-port DST_PORT
                            target destination port number to control traffic.
      --src-port SRC_PORT   target source port number to control traffic.
      --ipv6                apply traffic control to IPv6 packets rather than
                            IPv4.
